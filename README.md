Developed a speech recognition system to predict the spoken word among 10 classes using MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) as the feature engineering technique to extract features from voice signals. The extracted features were fed into a VGG model. Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
